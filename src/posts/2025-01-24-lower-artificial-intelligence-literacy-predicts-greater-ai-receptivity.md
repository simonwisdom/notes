This paper finds that people with lower AI literacy are more receptive to AI due to perceiving it as magical and awe-inspiring.

This matches some of my recent anecdotal experience.

- The people I know who are most sceptical of AI don't use it regularly, or at all, and aren't even sure how
- There are some who use it blindly for everything, and this results in, predictably, a lot of slop
- I try to fall somewhere between the 'Critical' and 'Engaged'. It's mostly empowerign me to do way more than I could before. I think there is a lot more I could be using it for

I tend to think of it like this:
