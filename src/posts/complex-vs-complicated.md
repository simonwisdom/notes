Many people use "complex" and "complicated" interchangeably, but these terms describe fundamentally different types of systems and problems.

A **complicated** system has many parts and steps, but follows predictable patterns. Think of a mechanical watch: it has numerous tiny components working together in a fixed way. Once you understand the mechanism, you can reliably predict its behavior.

A **complex** system, however, involves multiple interacting elements with emergent behaviors that can't be easily predicted. Natural ecosystems are complex: changing one element can cause unexpected ripple effects throughout the system. You can understand the individual parts, but their interactions create unpredictable outcomes.

Similarly, "simple" and "easy" are often conflated but mean different things:

- **Simple** refers to something with few moving parts or dependencies. It's the opposite of complex/complicated.
- **Easy** refers to something requiring little effort or expertise. Something can be simple but not easy (like running a marathon), or easy but not simple (like using a smartphone).
